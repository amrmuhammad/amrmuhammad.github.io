 
 How very pure sand (SiO2) is converted into mono-crystalline silicon
 
 <br />
 
 Silicon is the most abundant solid element on earth, being second only to oxygen and it makes up more than 25% of 
 the earthâ€™s crust. However, it rarely occurs in elemental form, virtually all of it is existing as compounds.

<br />
<br />
In this lecture the question will be answered how very pure sand (SiO2) is 
converted into mono-crystalline silicon and later on into silicon detectors. 
<br />
<br />
After a description of the different growth techniques for mono-crystalline silicon with special interest
in the material used in this work it is shown which kind of detectors have been used and how they have been produced.
