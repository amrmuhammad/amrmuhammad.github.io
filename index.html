Bio.
Muslim. My name is Amr Muhammad (in arabic: عمرو محمد). 
I am interested in every aspect of Computing (Hardware/Software). 
I have five years experience working as a Software Developemnt Engineer at Mentor Graphics (https://www.mentor.com) 
(accquired by siemens: https://eda.sw.siemens.com/en-US/).

<br />
  
My work there was inside the Design to Silicon (D2S) Divison - on the Pattern Matching product 
(https://eda.sw.siemens.com/en-US/ic/calibre-design/physical-verification/pattern-matching/) - part of the Calibre product used 
for Physical Design Verification. Specifically, I worked on the Pattern Capture command which is used to automatically capture 
patterns from the layout file using a Mask layer or a hotspot layer with a halo around the hotspot. The command can capture
multi-layer patterns and stores the patterns in a local database file. It eliminates duplicate patterns before storing the patterns.
